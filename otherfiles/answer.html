                        <h2>The long and short term consequences</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">In 6 weeks, the Japanese imperial military managed to kill an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 Chinese individuals, which included soldiers, civilians, the old and the young. In their wrath, the Japanese spared practically no one. Many times they would harass the refugees within the Nanking Neutral zone and claim more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraph">Nanking used to be China’s most prosperous city and industrial center. It had been the capital of the Nationalist Chinese from 1928 until 1937 when the Japanese invaded the city. Nanking (Nanjing) took decades to recover from the war and was replaced by Beijing as the capital. Sino-Japanese relations soured and remain bitter to this day. Compared to the atrocities Germany committed, Japan is much less open to discussing their own atrocities within the country. In fact, many Japanese individuals deny the event and some textbook revisionists alter the truth of the event or remove it entirely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>May 1, 1946, Prince Asaka denied the existence of massacre and claimed to never have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.
                            </li>
                            <li>In September 1986, Japanese education minister Fujio Masayuki, referred to the Rape of Nanking as “just a part of war.”</li>
                            <li>In 1988, a 30-second scene depicting the Rape of Nanking was removed from The Last Emperor by the film’s Japanese distributor.</li>
                            <li>General Nagano Shigeto, a WWII veteran appointed justice minister in Spring 1994, told a Japanese newspaper that “the Nanking Massacre and the rest was a fabrication.”</li>
                            <li>Kajiyama Seiroku, Japanese chief cabinet secretary outraged several asian countries: stated that sex slaves and rape victims of Japanese imperial army during WWII were not slaves at all but willingly engaged in prostitution. In January 1997, he proclaimed that the comfort women of the Japanese army were no different from the Japanese prostitutes who were working legally in Japan at the time.
                            </li>
                            <li>1977 minister of education revised history textbooks, removing sections that mentioned Japanese war atrocities, or the forced evacuations of Chinese and Korean prisoners to labor camps in Japan.</li>
                            <li>Textbooks have either ignored the massacre at Nanking altogether or put a decidedly Japanese spin on the actions of the military.</li>
                            <li>In 1991, censors at the Ministry of Education “ordered textbook authorities to eliminate all reference to the numbers of Chinese killed during the Rape of Nanking because authorities believed there was insufficient evidence to verify those numbers.”</li>
                            <li>In 1965, Ienaga Saburo, Japanese historian and history textbook writer, sued the Japanese government:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Legal battle that spanned 3 decades.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Ministry interfered with Inenaga’s attempts to document the Nanking massacre for school children.</li>
                                    <li>The examiner of Ienaga’s textbook manuscript, which had detailed the event, commented “Readers might interpret this description as meaning that the Japanese Army unilaterally massacred Chinese immediately after the occupation. This passage should be revised so that it is not interpreted in such a way.”
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The examiner demanded Ienaga to delete his description of the Rape itself, claiming that, “The violation of women is something that has happened on every battlefield in every era of human history. This is not an issue that needs to be taken up with respect to the Japanese Army in particular.”
                                    </li>
                                    <li>When the case won, extremists fired off death threats to the plaintiff attorneys, the judge Sugimoto Ryokichi and Ienaga himself, while thugs kept the scholar awake by banging pots and pans outside his home and screaming slogans.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In 1990 Ishihara Shintaro, a leading member of Japan’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party told an interviewer: “People say that the Japanese made a holocaust there (in Nanking), but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese. It has tarnished the image of Japan, it is a lie.”
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">In the end, many people either lost their family members or were killed alongside them. Those who survived lived an existence accompanied by trauma and a painful reminder of the past and what’s been lost. They would continue to experience mental breakdowns and would never fully recover. Japanese soldiers that had no malicious intent during the war lived a life full of regret, sorrow and self-blame. In the end, reparations to the people whose lives were destroyed in the rampage was never fully received.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Apologies</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">On August 15, 1995, the Japanese prime minister Murayama gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war, the aggression and the great suffering that it brought on Asia. The Emperor offered his condolences and expressed hope that such awful things would never occur again. A written apology from Japan was expected from China as opposed to the message to the international community.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraph">Azuma Shiro, a notable Japanese soldier, admitted his participation in the war crimes against the Chinese. He blames a system which he says produced a military that believed human life had no value.</p>
