                        <h4>Context</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Before we can understand The Nanking Massacre, we must first understand its context. Before The Second Sino-Japanese war, Japan, led by the emperor, had become a highly militaristic society. During the Meiji restoration, the population had adhered to warrior and feudal codes, translating into a religious devotion to the Emperor. This, combined with Japanese isolation contributed to the development of a xenophobic mentality. The Japanese had viewed their culture as the most sophisticated and civilized. This national pride continued to grow and the imperial army had become so prejudiced against the chinese to the point that killing human beings had become easy.

                        <p class="paragraph">During the first Sino-Japanese war, ultranationalism, a centralized state and European technology allowed Japan to win and be successful. Requirements of both a growing population and military led to Japan expanding into China to create lebensraum. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, which offered resources and living space. Japan’s casus belli was their false accusation of a Chinese sabotage of their railway. While the Japanese army was taking over all of the cities along South Manchuria, the Republic of China surprisingly didn’t resist.</p>

                        <h4>Second Sino-Japanese war and the road to Nanking</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">The Second Sino-Japanese war began on July 7, 1937. On November 8th, Chinese defenders retreated inside the city of Nanking. Japan was able to control the south portion of the city and Chiang ultimately retreated from the city. During the war, Chinese and Japanese forces fought hard. Because the Japanese had thought the war would be won with an easy victory, they had become frustrated. This frustration was targeted at the citizens, thus leading to the brutal massacres and rapes of the civilians. After winning in Shanghai, the Japanese turned towards Nanking. Then, Chinese nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek ordered:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Chinese troops to leave the city.</li>
                            <li>The City’s citizens to remain within the city (many left but some stayed and were massacred).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">Nanking’s neutral zone was set up by ICNSZ, where Nanking’s citizens took refuge in. A notable member of the ICNSZ is John Rabe, a Nazi and German businessman who ended up saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Japanese soldiers enter Nanking on December 13, 1937. Along the way, they had already committed atrocities.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Thus, to demoralize the Chinese to keep them from fighting effectively, Japanese General Matsui Iwane ordered the destruction of the city of Nanking. Thus he encouraged and even ordered the soldiers to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Loot and burn the surrounding towns and a third of the city’s buildings.</li>
                            <li>Launch a campaign of atrocities against civilians. This is what had become known as the Nanking Massacre, or the Rape of Nanking.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">The massacre started on December 13 1937 and had lasted for 6 weeks. During the massacre:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>150,000 male "war prisoners" were butchered.</li>
                            <li>50,000 male civilians had been violently killed.</li>
                            <li>Between 20k to 80k women and children were sexually assaulted, many of whom were mutilated or killed in the process.</li>
                            <li>Japanese soldiers attacked refugees in the neutral zone.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">In the end of the massacre, the total death toll estimated between 100,000 to 300,000. In 1940, Japan made Nanjing the capital of their Chinese puppet government, headed by Wang Jingwei.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Thus in summary, the Rape of Nanking, or the Nanking massacre, had occured as a result of extreme indoctrination and as a result of the extreme xenophobic beliefs and values held by Japanese civilians and soldiers. Virtually every Japanese in that time period hold the emperor to such a high degree of reverence to the point that those who do not possess the same amount of worship isn't a human. Because of this, national interests, domestic and foreign affairs of the country had become centered around devotion to the Emperor of Japan.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraph">Because the Chinese do not worship Japan's emperor, they make dehumanization easy. During the war, Japanese soldiers had become frustrated of the growing fierceness of the Chinese resistance and of the war's prolonging duration. In order to relieve stress, to entertain themselves and raise morale, Japanese soldiers were free to do whatever they want to do to Chinese citizens and possessions.</p>
