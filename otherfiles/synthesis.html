                        <h2>How did the Japanese bring about The Massacre?</h4>
                        <h4>Result</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Japanese soldiers had launched a campaign of atrocities against civilians that had resulted in a death toll estimated to be around 300,000. The massacre spanned over 6 weeks, thus the Japanese had been killing around 7,143 people per day. Those deaths are composed roughly of around 150,000 male war prisoners, 50,000 civilians, twenty to eighty thousand women and children and refugees within the Nanking neutral zone.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Methods</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">This begs the question, how were the Japanese able to accumulate so many kills in a short amount of time? From what we know earlier from the last "why they did it," the Japanese were able to easily kill and rape Chinese civilians because of their extreme xenophobic beliefs and values. We must also consider, that coming from that kind of nation, that their officers would expect obedience and utmost devotion to Japan and the emperor soldiers. These soldiers that do not follow orders from officers were in danger of being executed themselves.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraph">Discussing committment and willingness aside, the physical means of massacre and rape are often horrible as one can tell. The following pictures from the massacre can explain how and in what way:</p>

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Japanese soldiers spared little to no individual in their wake. They were able to do as they please as long as their actions did not intervene with Japanese interests, which we can recognize was ultranationalistic. Thusly, the Japanese soldiers treated the Chinese as play-things. Most of the kills had been caused by group execution by guns. </p>
