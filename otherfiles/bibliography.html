                        <h2>Should individuals, governments, or both be held accountable for crimes against humanity?</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">Both should be held accountable for crimes aganist humanity. Individuals, or the people of the country, create and influence the government of their country. At the same time however, the governments that were created from the populace are able to inluence the populace themselves. What could be influenced between the both of them are their interests and the decisions they make. While a third party is able to intervene in the politics of the same country, with respect to crimes against humanity, that third party would be responsible for the cause.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraph">With regards to the Nanking massacre, Japan had become a totalitarianistic and ultranationlistic country. A surge of nationalism swept over the country after the Great Depression, during which Japan had become incredible distrustful of Western things and had become traditionalistic. Political parties that had adhered with the interests of the people were put into power. Just like with Germany, values of domination and conquest of the people lead them to elect great military leaders. In the end for our case with Japan, both the people and the government are to be blamed for. Although, the government should be a little bit more responsible however, as while Japan had already become a nationalistic nation focused on conquest, the government had entrenched ultranationalism into every single one of the civilians and soldiers. They were also fully responsible for managing the conduct of the military during the massacre.</p>
