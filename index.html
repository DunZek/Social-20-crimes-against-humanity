                        <p class="paragraph">The Rape of Nanking, or the Nanking massacre, had occured as a result of extreme indoctrination and as a result of the extreme xenophobic beliefs and values held by Japanese civilians and soldiers. Virtually every Japanese in that time period hold the emperor to such a high degree of reverence to the point that those who do not possess the same amount of worship isn't a human. Because of this, national interests, domestic and foreign affairs of the country had become centered around devotion to the Emperor of Japan...

They were able to do as they please as long as their actions did not intervene with Japanese interests, which we can recognize was ultranationalistic. Thusly, the Japanese soldiers treated the Chinese as play-things. Most of the kills had been caused by group execution by guns...</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">In the end, many people either lost their family members or were killed alongside them. Those who survived lived an existence accompanied by trauma and a painful reminder of the past and what’s been lost. They would continue to experience mental breakdowns and would never fully recover. Japanese soldiers that had no malicious intent during the war lived a life full of regret, sorrow and self-blame. In the end, reparations to the people whose lives were destroyed in the rampage was never fully received...</p>

                        <h2>The answer to the main question</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">Both should be held accountable for crimes aganist humanity. Individuals, or the people of the country, create and influence the government of their country. At the same time however, the governments that were created from the populace are able to inluence the populace themselves. What could be influenced between the both of them are their interests and the decisions they make. While a third party is able to intervene in the politics of the same country, with respect to crimes against humanity, that third party would be responsible for the cause.</p>
